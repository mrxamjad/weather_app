Schools, markets, shops, and other services were shut in parts of Rajasthan, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh.

Police lathicharged protestors in Bihar's Patna. Meanwhile, Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav, BSP leader Mayawati, and several Congress leader have extended their support to Bharat Bandh taking place today.
Why is Bharat Bandh today?
Several organisations and groups have called for a Bharat Bandh on Wednesday, August 21. The strike is to oppose the Supreme Court's ruling to exclude the “creamy layer" from the SC/ST quota. The move has sparked controversy, leading to the Bharat Bandh on Wednesday. 
Supreme Court judgement on SC/ST quota system
The apex court, on August 1, permitted states to have the power to sub-classify SCs and STs while deciding if the class is adequately represented. The Supreme Court also made it clear that the state governments have to make sub-classification based on “quantifiable and demonstrable data" of backwardness and representation in government jobs and not on “whims" and as a matter of “political expediency".
The Supreme Court ruled by a majority judgement of 6:1, that sub-classification within the SCs and STs reservation is permissible. As many as six separate opinions were delivered in the case.
The judgement was delivered by the seven-judge bench led by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, which overruled earlier judgement in the EV Chinnaiah matter, which had held that sub-classification was not permissible because SC/STs form homogenous classes.
